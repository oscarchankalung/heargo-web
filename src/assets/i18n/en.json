      "title": "FAQ",
      "question_1": "Does the hearing test conducted during the visiting service reach the standard of those at a clinic?",
      "answer_1": "Yes. All our specialised portable equipment meet the performance and calibration requirements of the relevant standards. The test procedures are the same as any standard hearing test at the clinic. We also ensure the ambient noise of the test environment is within accepted limits, and use insert earphones when necessary to minimise the effect of ambient noise and ensure test accuracy.",
      "question_2": "Are there any drawbacks to a visiting service compared to a traditional clinic visit?",
      "answer_2": "No. In fact, there are plenty of advantages for a visiting service. If the test determines that you are suffering from hearing loss and hearing aids are recommended, a hearing aids trial will be provided right away. This will give you the most accurate demonstration of how well the hearing aids function for your everyday activities. Our patients have also reflected that being in the comfort of their home makes the experience more relaxing.",
      "question_3": "How long will the appointment last?",
      "answer_3": "Depending on the service type, with up to 180 minutes per session.",
      "question_4": "How often should I book an appointment?",
      "answer_4": "If you are a hearing aid user suffering from hearing loss, we recommend annual hearing test to monitor any decline to your hearing and to keep the settings on your hearing aids updated.",
      "question_5": "What does the service fee cover?",
      "answer_5": "Service fee covers visiting consultation and service charge, transportation fee and electronic Simplified hearing test report.",
      "question_6": "Will there be only one visiting specialist for the service?",
      "answer_6": "The number of visiting specialist per session depends on the service type. For example, 2 specialists will be sent for a hearing aids fitting service.",
      "question_7": "How will you charge if two people require your visiting service at the same location?",
      "answer_7": "Our service is one-to-one. Therefore, service duration and charge depends on the number of people that require the service. For example, two people requiring hearing test at the same location, the total charge will be $1800 (60 min.) x 2 = $3200 (120 min. in total). Please specify the number of people requiring service at the time of booking."
